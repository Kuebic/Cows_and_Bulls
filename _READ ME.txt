To run the game: double click on cnbgame.pyw

Enter letters by clicking corresponding letters on the screen.
Guess the word the game is thinking of.  Choose between 3-4-5 letter English words.
A Cow (white) means a letter is correct, but not in the right place.
A Bull (black) means a letter is correct and in the right place.

One glitch that sometimes happens is when starting a new game,it sometimes has difficulty removing all the pictures of the cows and bulls and crashes.  Works well otherwise.
